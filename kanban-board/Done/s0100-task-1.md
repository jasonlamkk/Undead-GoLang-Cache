I need to submit point and drop-off locations
( detail : token shall be return and token visible on other note; 
 existence shall be validated by /route/{token} 
 token shall follow IETF RFC4122 format
 dummy JSON output return if token exists ; {"status": "fail"} return if token not exist. no map api logic)


* done and testing
 tested by 
   l_201711/main_test.sh

go to root folder 
#cd l_201711
#sh main_test.sh

part 1
gopath setup 
go dependence installed

part 2
server will be built and 3 instance will be started

node 1 start
node 2 knows node 1 and join the cluster
node 3 knows node 2 but not node 1 join the cluster ; node 2 tells node 3 node 1 exists
node 3 join node 1

part 3
use curl to submit data to node 1
 - node 1 notify node 2 and node 3, tell this token belongs to node 1
use curl to fetch/get the respective token, from node 3
 - node 3 knows node 1 has 1, proxy the request and fetch data from node 1
 - all node are Identical and no special load-balancer is needed
 - easy to scale out unlimitedly , no external database needed, no single point of failure, small foot-print

part 4
kill all ./server process
